{"response": "Okay, I'm ready. Please provide the Burning Man transformation narratives you want me to analyze. I will apply the four-part analysis format you requested:\n\n1.  **Does the person mention a physical hardship (Mud, Heat, Dust, Hunger, Exhaustion, Logistics)?**\n2.  **Does the person describe a breakthrough or shift?**\n3.  **Rate the 'Intensity of Ordeal' mentioned (None, Low, Medium, High).**\n4.  **Is the hardship described as a REASON for the transformation? (Yes/No).**\n\nI will provide the analysis in the format:\n\nHardship: \\[Level], Breakthrough: \\[Yes/No], Reason: \\[Yes/No]\n\n**Example:**\n\n**Narrative:** \"The dust storms were relentless. I was covered in grit from head to toe, and my lungs burned. But seeing the community come together to help each other during the storms really changed my perspective. I learned to appreciate the support I have in my life.\"\n\n**Analysis:** Hardship: High, Breakthrough: Yes, Reason: Yes"}

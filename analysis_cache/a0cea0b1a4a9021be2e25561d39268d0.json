{"response": "I BUILT MY SHADE STRUCTURE (PVC + TARP) At 14:00 AM THURSDAY. THE WIND DESTROYED IT AND I HAD TO SLEEP IN MY TRUCK, COVERED IN DUST, WITH THIS TARP FLAPPING IN THE WIND, POUNDING ON THE CANS. ONE OF MY COOLERS FLIPPED THREE TIMES AND GOT RUINED. I SINCERELY WONDERED IF I TOOK MY ONE VACATION IN 5 YEARS WHY TO COME OVER TO THE DESERT AND CRY IN MY TRUCK."}

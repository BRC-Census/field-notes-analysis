# Burning Man Field Notes: Comprehensive Thematic Analysis

## Executive Summary

This report synthesizes findings from a mixed-method analysis of 2024-2025 field notes. The conclusions below are derived directly from the semantic analysis of participant narratives.

### 1 Transformation
**Thematic Overlap:** 1 of the top 5 themes are shared between Virgins and Elders (Openness), indicating core structural similarities. **Linguistic Stability:** Both groups maintain a similar balance of self-vs-collective language (Virgin: 8.4, Elder: 7.5). However, there is a **notable thematic shift**. Virgins prioritize **Anticipation, Acceptance, Focus, Perspective Shift**. Elders shift towards **Community, Perspective, Connection, Creativity**.

### 2 Survival
**The Ordeal Gap:** Hardship is prevalent (Baseline ~8.8%), but only 8.4% of transformation narratives mention it. **Hypothesis Weakened:** The 'Ordeal Hypothesis' is largely unsupported by the data; participants describe transformation through social and creative lenses, not physical survival.

### 3 Identity
**Motivation Profile:** The most common motivation for wearing costumes is **Play** (46.5%). Play is the clear primary driver, with Authenticity (22.8%) as a secondary theme. Data suggests the costume functions more as a **Mirror** (Authenticity: 22.8%) than a **Mask** (Disguise: 0.0%).

### 4 Symbolism
**Temple leans towards Grief:** While present in both, Grief is more prevalent in Temple narratives (13.6% vs 3.0%). **Ambivalence toward the Man:** 'Indifference' is the most common reaction to the Man, suggesting a potential disconnect or routinization of the symbol. 

**Gender Analysis:** **Male Resonance with Grief:** Men are more likely (16.1% vs 10.6%) to explicitly describe the Temple as a place of grief.

### 5 Diversity
**Experience Breakdown:** 6.5% reported Positive experiences, while 82.3% reported Negative or Mixed impacts related to their identity. **Baseline Consistency:** General experience sentiment was relatively consistent between groups (Friction: 21.4% marginalized vs 22.8% majority). **Generational Friction:** The highest rate of reported social friction was found in the **30-39** cohort (26.5%).

### 6 Relationships

# Module 5: The 'Other' in Utopia (Diversity & Inclusion)

**Research Question:** How does the marginalized experience differ from the 'Radical Inclusion' ideal?

**Methodology:** Comparative analysis of 62 diversity narratives and cross-set sentiment analysis of 171 general responses, segmented by Identity and **Age**. Sample size: Full Dataset.


## Important Methodology Note
> **Selection Bias Context:** The figures in Section 1 (82.3% Negative/Mixed Impact) represent responses to a survey specifically titled 'Diversity and Identity'. This creates a possible self-selection effect: participants who have experienced identity-related friction may be more likely to choose this question set. Therefore, this percentage should **not** be interpreted as the experience of all marginalized people at Burning Man, but rather as a thematic clustering of the *types* of friction encountered by those for whom identity was a salient factor in their burn.
> **Baseline Comparison:** Section 2 provides a more representative view by looking at general experience surveys (Emotions/Experiences) where identity was not the prompt. Here, we see that Marginalized groups report general social friction at rates similar to the majority baseline, suggesting that while specific identity-based friction exists, it does not necessarily result in a more negative experience overall compared to the majority.

## 1. Diversity Survey Results
- **Negative/Mixed Impact:** 51 (82.3%)
- **Code Switching:** 11 (17.7%)
- **Top Themes:** Exoticism, Racism, Othering

## 2. General Experience Baseline (Cross-Set Analysis)
| Group | Avg Sentiment | Friction Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Majority (Men) | 0.12 | 22.8% |
| Marginalized (NB/O) | 0.13 | 21.4% |

### Age Analysis: Friction by Generation
| Age Group | Friction Rate |
| :--- | :--- |
| Under 30 | 22.9% |
| 30-39 | 26.5% |
| 40-49 | 23.7% |
| 50+ | 22.2% |

## Conclusion
> **Experience Breakdown:** 6.5% reported Positive experiences, while 82.3% reported Negative or Mixed impacts related to their identity. **Baseline Consistency:** General experience sentiment was relatively consistent between groups (Friction: 21.4% marginalized vs 22.8% majority). **Generational Friction:** The highest rate of reported social friction was found in the **30-39** cohort (26.5%).

# Burning Man Field Notes: Comprehensive Thematic Analysis

## Executive Summary

This report synthesizes findings from a mixed-method analysis of 2024-2025 field notes. The conclusions below are derived directly from the semantic analysis of participant narratives.

### 1 Transformation
**Thematic Overlap:** 1 of the top 5 themes are shared between Virgins and Elders (Community), indicating core structural similarities. **Linguistic Stability:** Both groups maintain a similar balance of self-vs-collective language (Virgin: 6.7, Elder: 18.0). However, there is a **notable thematic shift**. Virgins prioritize **Anticipation, Uncertainty, Transformation, Reflection**. Elders shift towards **Connection, Creativity, Relationships, Openness**.

### 2 Survival
**The Ordeal Gap:** While 8.1% of participants in survival surveys report significant physical hardship, only 8.4% of those describing a transformation mention it as a factor. **Hypothesis Weakened:** The 'Ordeal Hypothesis' is largely unsupported by the data; participants describe transformation through social and creative lenses, not physical survival.

### 3 Identity
**Motivation Profile:** The most common motivation for wearing costumes is **Play** (46.5%). Play is the clear primary driver, with Authenticity (22.8%) as a secondary theme. Data suggests the costume functions more as a **Mirror** (Authenticity: 22.8%) than a **Mask** (Disguise: 0.0%).

### 4 Symbolism
**Temple leans towards Grief:** While present in both, Grief is more prevalent in Temple narratives (13.6% vs 3.0%). **Ambivalence toward the Man:** 'Indifference' is the most common reaction to the Man, suggesting a potential disconnect or routinization of the symbol. 

**Gender Analysis:** **Male Resonance with Grief:** Men are more likely (16.1% vs 10.6%) to explicitly describe the Temple as a place of grief.

### 5 Diversity
**Experience Breakdown:** 6.5% reported Positive experiences, while 82.3% reported Negative or Mixed impacts related to their identity. **Baseline Consistency:** General experience sentiment was relatively consistent between groups (Friction: 40.5% marginalized vs 46.8% majority).

### 6 Relationships
**Connection Intensity:** 58.3% of respondents report that playa relationships are more intense or authentic than those in the default world. There is a significant split in experience, with many finding deeper connections while others see them as similar to default world interactions.

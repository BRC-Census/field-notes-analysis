# Module 5: The 'Other' in Utopia (Diversity & Inclusion)

**Research Question:** How does the marginalized experience differ from the 'Radical Inclusion' ideal?

**Methodology:** Comparative analysis of 62 diversity narratives and cross-set sentiment analysis of 171 general responses, segmented by Identity and **Age**. Sample size: Full Dataset.


## Important Methodology Note
> **Selection Bias Context:** The figures in Section 1 (82.3% Negative/Mixed Impact) represent responses to a survey specifically titled 'Diversity and Identity'. This creates a possible self-selection effect: participants who have experienced identity-related friction may be more likely to choose this question set. Therefore, this percentage should **not** be interpreted as the experience of all marginalized people at Burning Man, but rather as a thematic clustering of the *types* of friction encountered by those for whom identity was a salient factor in their burn.
> **Baseline Comparison:** Section 2 provides a more representative view by looking at general experience surveys (Emotions/Experiences) where identity was not the prompt. Here, we see that Marginalized groups report general social friction at rates similar to the majority baseline, suggesting that while specific identity-based friction exists, it does not necessarily result in a more negative experience overall compared to the majority.

## 1. Diversity Survey Results
- **Negative/Mixed Impact:** 51 (82.3%)
- **Code Switching:** 11 (17.7%)
- **Top Themes:** Exoticism, Racism, Othering

## 2. General Experience Baseline (Cross-Set Analysis)
| Group | Avg Sentiment | Friction Rate |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Majority (Men) | 0.12 | 22.8% |
| Marginalized (NB/O) | 0.13 | 21.4% |

### Age Analysis: Friction by Generation
| Age Group | Friction Rate |
| :--- | :--- |
| Under 30 | 22.9% |
| 30-39 | 26.5% |
| 40-49 | 23.7% |
| 50+ | 22.2% |

## Conclusion
> **Experience Breakdown:** 6.5% reported Positive experiences, while 82.3% reported Negative or Mixed impacts related to their identity. **Baseline Consistency:** General experience sentiment was relatively consistent between groups (Friction: 21.4% marginalized vs 22.8% majority). **Generational Friction:** The highest rate of reported social friction was found in the **30-39** cohort (26.5%).

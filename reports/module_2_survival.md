## Conclusion
> **The Ordeal Gap:** Hardship is prevalent (Baseline ~7.5%), but only 9.2% of transformation narratives mention it. **Hypothesis Weakened:** The 'Ordeal Hypothesis' is largely unsupported by the data; participants describe transformation through social and creative lenses, not physical survival.

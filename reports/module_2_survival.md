# Module 2: The 'Ordeal' as Catalyst (Survival vs. Epiphany)

**Methodology:** Comparative analysis of 74 survival responses (Baseline) vs 131 transformation narratives.

### Findings
- **Baseline Hardship Prevalence:** 8.1%
- **Transformation Narratives Mentioning Hardship:** 8.4%
- **Hardship as Explicit Catalyst:** 3.1%

### Hardship Intensity (Transformation Set)
| Level | Count |
| :--- | :--- |
| High | 1 |
| Medium | 7 |
| Low | 3 |
| None | 120 |

## Conclusion
> **The Ordeal Gap:** While 8.1% of participants in survival surveys report significant physical hardship, only 8.4% of those describing a transformation mention it as a factor. **Hypothesis Weakened:** The 'Ordeal Hypothesis' is largely unsupported by the data; participants describe transformation through social and creative lenses, not physical survival.
